파이썬을 이용해 DES, TDES를 시뮬레이션하는 코드입니다.

1. DES_main.py is a file using "Crypto.Cipher" to simulate the speed of DES/Double DES

**DES_realize.py and TDES.py does NOT use Cyrpto module. It works alone.**

2. DES_realize.py is a file realizing DES with NO modules. It only uses python basic modules, so none of the moduels are needed.
3. TDES.py is a code testing the speed between DES/Triple DES. It uses DES_realize.py for the basic.

It may have some errors, so be aware of using.\
It has only Korean annotations. English annotations will be updated in the future.
