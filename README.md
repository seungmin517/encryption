1. DES_main.py is a file using "Crypto.Cipher" to simulate the speed of DES/Double DES

-DES_realize.py and TDES.py does NOT use Cyrpto module. It works alone.
2. DES_realize.py is a file realizing DES with NO modules. It only uses python basic modules, so none of the moduels are needed.
3. TDES.py is a code testing the speed between DES/Triple DES. It uses DES_realize.py for the basic.
